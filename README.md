# Template for CASE Project
> Created by CASE Board 19/20

**This is a template to be used by all projects in CASE. The template contains a folder structure that covers hardware and software projects. **   

> A sample README by *fvcproductions* can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/fvcproductions/1bfc2d4aecb01a834b46). 

> A cheatsheet by *Adam Pritchard* for writing Markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Goals 
The goal for this project is to create a line following robot which can compete in Robot SM 2020 and not be last. In doing so we hope to further develop our knowledge in programming, CADing and development of cyber physical systems.
